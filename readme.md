MovieVoter
==========

A simple application for generating a *To Watch* list of movies between a small group of friends.
Submitted movies can be up- or down-voted by the users.

Movies can be submitted using a search tool which leverages the [Themoviedb](http://www.themoviedb.org/) API ([API Documentation](http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)).
This API will provide basic movie information and assets.

After submitting a movie, ratings will be grabbed from IMDB and RottenTomatoes using the following API's:
* [The Open Movie Database API ](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (IMDB)
* [RottenTomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/)
